# BreakingBad

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0.
From Brad Traversy's YT tut. Just the breaking bad cast with some info,  a card flip and some search capabilities. This was originally done in React but  I did it in Angular.
I need to move some things around probably Idont think its the most efficient but hey it works!
